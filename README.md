# Fit Check

Fit Check is a mobile friendly website where users can create an account to store clothing item into their closet,
find the most aesthetically pleasing outfits from their closet based on color theory, and calculate fit score for outfit chosen.

## Inspiration
As someone in college, I wanted to dress nice, but it was a bit time consuming for me to pick an outfit every morning. 
I wished there was a website that can tell me the best possible outfits from my closet, and I knew a lot of my friends have experienced the same struggles before.

After learning about color theory, I was amazed by how designers use this combination of scientific and artistic approach to create visually pleasing outfits.
I found it so cool that we can use scientific principles to discover artistic values, 
so I built Fit Check, where people can store their clothing item into their closet account, find the most aesthetically pleasing outfits based on color theory, and calculate fit score for any outfit.

## Features
- Fundamentals of color theory
- User authentication
- Closet management
- Adding and deleting clothing items in Closet
- Using the Color API and my own algorithm to calculate the most visually pleasing outfits from the user's Closet based on color theory
- Categorizing the best outfits into three color schemes: monochromatic, analogous, and complementary
- Computing fit score for outfit picked by the user on the color schemes

## Future
After I finished building the project, I realized that people with color blindness could use this technology to sort their closets and pick outfits.
We all like dressing nice, so I believe with some modifications of features
this website can help people with vision disability pick nice outfits.
Hence, I plan on adding a camera feature where users can take a picture of the clothing, and store it in the closet account. My goal is to design an 
algorithm that can identify the type of clothing and its color, so that people with vision disability can use it freely anywhere without anyone's help.
